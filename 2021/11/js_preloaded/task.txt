In C++ (not via Puppeteer), directly in Chromium:
I want to be able to add a script that will be preloaded with every frames
(main frame) and subframes (iframes), it's a 100KB JS script, this will have to
be compile cached as well for performances. it's very performance sensitive.

Right now =>

    1) Load page
    2) Add script on top (we lose 50ms doing that)

What we want is:

    1) Load script (before the page even)
    2) Load page

The only criterias are:

- We need to be able to change that script without having to recompile chromium
  of course, so it can be a filepath as a chrome flag (argumment) where we pass
  a filepath for example
- Has to work in headless mode and headful (with puppeteer) on Windows/Mac/Linux
