Subject: [PATCH v1 0/5] Add custom preloaded JavaScript for chromium

Hi @vocafeuvre,

## Introduction

This is a patchset to add custom preloaded JavaScript for chromium. There are 5 patches in this series, all will be posted as a reply to this one.

This series is based on the chromium project at commit:
51596eab97360072521c8145c4f734b70c176884 ("IWYU: add cstring for memset in blink::WebPrivatePtr")


## Summary of the patches:

[PATCH 1/5]: base: Create JSPreloadFrameHost class.

This is used to preload a JavaScript file at initialization. It reads a JavaScript code from the given filename and saves it on a global state. The saved JavaScript code will be reused as much as possible. The only thing that requires us to re-open the file is that, when we have separated process that doesn't have the g_js_preload yet (still nullptr).


[PATCH 2/5]: content_main.cc: Initialize JSPreloadFrameHost globally.

We initialize JSPreloadFrameHost at initialization here, the next called functions then can use the preloaded JavaScript. Before we return, we destroy the instance. IOW, this is a long-lived object that will be reused many times.


[PATCH 3/5]: render_thread_impl.cc: Register preloaded JS as extension/

At this point, we register the preloaded JavaScript that lives in ::g_js_preload as a v8 extension.


[PATCH 4/5]: render_frame_impl.cc: Call the preloaded JS script in all frames
This will execute the following small JavaScript code:
if (typeof __preloaded_javascript_func == 'function') {
   __preloaded_javascript_func();
}

Note:
We pre-compiled cached the __preloaded_javascript_func() via
RegisterExtension() as a v8 extension and we call the function here.

Note:
The typeof checks is just to make sure no error happens when the
extension is not defined.


[PATCH 5/5]: content_main: Handle --preload-js-file cmd argument
This adds support to preload JS file from a command line argument.

The use of CHROMIUM_JS_PRELOAD_FILE is still supported, the
--preload-js-file file will override the env var.

Usage example:
chrome --preload-js-file=/home/ammarfaizi2/work/chromium-wrk-notes/test/test.js

The chromium will preload (compile cached) that test.js and it will call __preloaded_javascript_func function in all frames.


## How is this tested?
This patchset has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 21.10. It works both in headless and headful mode.

Please review!
Thanks!
