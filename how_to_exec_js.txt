I want to create some kind of plugin fro my custom Chromium build, and I need to execute some JavaScript code.
I did it, by using WebContents.evaluateJavaScript() method, but it is not work in iframe.
I tried to set disable-web-security switch in args.gn, but it does not work, and it looks like as a security hole also.
Are there any way to execute some inbuilt JavaScript in iframes for every webpage?

From C++, one option is content::RenderFrameHost::ExecuteJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld() in combination with a content::WebContentsObserver.
Note that if you're using C++, there's often a better option though...
